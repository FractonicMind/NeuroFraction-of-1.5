# NeuroFraction-of-1.5  

🚀 **A groundbreaking neural network framework built on base-1.5 arithmetic**  
Autograd, GPU-ready, and designed to challenge traditional binary computing paradigms.  

---

## 📖 Overview  
This project implements a **fractional-base (base-1.5) neural network**, featuring:  
- A custom `Base15Number` class supporting normalization, arithmetic operations, and float conversion  
- Full autograd compatibility for gradient-based learning  
- A modular design to explore non-binary computation in AI  

---

## ✨ Key Features  
✅ **Base-1.5 arithmetic engine** (addition, subtraction, multiplication)  
✅ **Automatic differentiation** (gradient tracking)  
✅ **Modular architecture** (`core`, `losses`, `optimizers` modules)  
✅ **GPU acceleration roadmap** (CUDA/FPGA support planned)  
✅ **MIT Licensed** — open-source and collaborative
