# NeuroFraction-of-1.5

ðŸš€ **A groundbreaking neural network framework built on base-1.5 arithmetic**  
*Autograd, GPU-ready, and designed to challenge traditional binary computing.*

---

## Overview

**NeuroFraction-of-1.5** is an experimental AI framework that reimagines neural computation using fractional-base (1.5) arithmetic instead of standard binary.  
This unique approach enables:
- Compact numerical representations
- Smooth fractional gradient flows
- Theoretical hardware acceleration possibilities
